Just another forum.

This is web forum, created as a way to help us understand how we can work together.

The project is using Python 3.6. We will also use [`Pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). You can install `pipenv` via `pip` and when you first clone this repo, do a `pipenv install` to prepare a virtualenv on your machine for this project. You activate the virtualenv with `pipenv shell`. You can also use `pipenv run` to just run a particular command in the virtualenv shell.
